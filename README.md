# Java Inheritance Example

This project demonstrates basic **inheritance** and **polymorphism** in Java using three classes:

- **Animal** — Superclass (parent)
- **Lion** — Subclass (child) that inherits from `Animal`
- **InheritanceDemo** — Main class used to run the example

The example shows how a subclass can inherit fields and methods from its superclass while also overriding behavior.
